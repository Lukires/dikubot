# music bot branch

This branch only has music bot features enabled.

## How to run

If you wish to run the bot, first you must replace the API keys found in the src/resources directory, with your own.
- src/resources/apitoken.txt must contain a Discord Bot API Token
- src/resources/sendgrindtoken.txt must contain a SendGrid API token (https://app.sendgrid.com)

You can simply call the **./execute.sh** script (on Linux) after you've added the tokens, or run the program through your IDE.

## Documentation

We're working on proper documentation, for now we just have our Javadocs at https://lukires.github.io/dikubot/
